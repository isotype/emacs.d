This repo is to first and foremost allow me to quickly access my
.emacs from anywhere, it is freely available if anyone wants to peruse
the various changes I have made to make emacs play better in our
modern world of computing.

the files available here are stored on my system in my **.emacs.d** folder
in my *$HOME* directory. It is also worth noting the file entitled
"Cask" as this file is a key component in my setup.

Cask is a tool for managing dependencies in emacs, it is similar to
Ruby's Bundler, or Quicklisp. To straight copy and paste my whole
emacs configuration you need to first install cask from [here](https://github.com/cask/cask)

Once you have installed cask you can place the files from the repo
inside your .emacs.d folder and then&#x2026;

    cd $HOME/.emacs.d
    cask install
    #if this fails
    #read the cask docs to figure out what I/you screwed up

I should also note that some of the stuff in my Cask file might not
actually be in use, if you want a lean install you might want to pull
some stuff out beforehand.

Anyways&#x2026;if you have any question about the stuff I'm using or how I
use it you can either check out my blog/junk pile of a website
[isoty.pe](http://isoty.pe) (you may get lucky and find a blog post going through some
random emacs package install), or you can leave me a comment as an
"issue" and I'd be more then happy to explain.
